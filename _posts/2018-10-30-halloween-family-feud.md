title: Cyber Feud/Costume Party
tagline: We asked 100 CS students... name a better way to spend Halloween Eve than playing Family Feud! Two teams will compete to find out how fellow CSU students answered questions about cybersecurity. Also better bring a security-themed costume -- low effort is encouraged!
